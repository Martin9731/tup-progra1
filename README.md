# TUP Programación Lógica #

## Description
These are exercises from the subject "Programación I - Lógica", belonging to the UTN Career "Tecnicatura en Programación."

## Goal
My goal here is not only to become familiar with Git, uploading these small programs and also commenting the code on each program to share it with my peers.
This last goal will not only allow me to share the code with them (since so many of them lack the proper skills, and practice so little) so they can understand and keep progressing towards the completion of this subject. It will also enable me to receive peer review, and keep the code 'alive' in real time, while also enabling me to share it in class (sometimes the connection at the University doesn't work properly, so I try and keep everything here as an extra failsafe).
